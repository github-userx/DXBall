	A simple DX Ball clone using SDL 2

		Features:
			-Multiplayer
			-Configurable colours
			-Bonuses
			-Resizeable boards
			-Level editor
			-Probably more...
Compiling:

UPDATE :
	You can now compile using sh buildDXB. This will do several things
		1. Crate a makefile based on DXBall.pro ( requires qmake )
		2. Build the makefile using the command make
		3. Based on command line options :
			-r run the program using command line ards in buildDXB.sh
			-g run gdb also using the gdb and game args in buildDXB.sh
			-v run valgrind using the valgrind and game ars stated in buildDXB.sh
	This will compile the project using the same settings as the command line below ( the old way )

	clang++ main.cpp Timer.cpp Tile.cpp Ball.cpp Paddle.cpp Renderer.cpp GameManager.cpp -lSDL -lSDL_ttf -lSDL_image -o DXBall -std=c++11 -Weverything -Wno-c++98-compat -Wno-c++98-compat-pedantic -Wno-padded -Wno-switch-enum -Werror

This will enable almost all warnings available in clang++ except@
	-Wno-c++98-compat 		- C++98 compability is no concern for this project ( though I might add functionality to enable C++ 98 support later )
	-Wno-c++98-compat-pedantic	- C++98 compability is no concern for this project ( though I might add functionality to enable C++ 98 support later )
	-Wno-switch-enum		- This warning warns if you are not explicitly handling all possible enum values in a switch. SDL_Keycode contains more than 230 values.
	-Wno-padded			- Padding issues are not a concern at the moment.

All other warnings are handled and should be dealt with if possible

Can also be compiled with G++ ( part of GCC ) with the same command excluding -Weverything and the -Wno-************** commands.

Valgrind :
	valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full -suppressions=valgrind/ignore

This will run valgrind and check the program for any leaks. There should be none.

If you remove the last comman ( suppression=valgrind/ignore ) you will get all "errors" from SDL, which probably isn't important to this game.

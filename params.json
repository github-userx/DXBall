{"name":"Dxball","tagline":"A DX Ball clone using SDL","body":"### Welcome to DX Ball Github Pages.\r\nThis project is first and foremost a hobby project for fun, to create my own game and to learn. The name is just temporary until I can come up with a name of my own. \r\n\r\n## About\r\nDX Ball is a Breakout type game where you have a ball and try to hit it with your paddle and knock away all the tiles. My clone will be quite similar to DX Ball, but with some differences. \r\n\r\n### Technology \r\nWhereas the original was only for Windows, this game will be multi-platform. It'll be made using the SDL 2.0 library. This means the code can run on virtually any platform ( Linux, Androird, Windows, iOS, OS X, etc... ) It also means that the code will run very smoothly. Currently the average FPS lives from 200 - 500, peaking at more than 10000 FPS. This is using Intel HD 4000 graphics card. With a better graphics card, the FPS would be a lot higher. \r\n\r\nLanguage wise the game is based on C++11. Most platforms support this newer version of C++ with the exception of iOS. For the iOS version, the C++11 code will have to be ported to Objective C. \r\n\r\n### Current features\r\n* Boards loaded from text files, supports and unlimited amount of boards.\r\n* Bonus effects. Currently just granting an extra life, but this will be improved later\r\n* Several different tiles ( explosive, regular, hard and unbreakable. )\r\n* Two-player features ( though currently just one can be controlle by a human. )\r\n* An unlimited amount of balls\r\n\r\n### Coming features\r\n* More bonus effects\r\n* TCP/UDP support\r\n* Config files for setting themes.\r\n* Particle effects\r\n* Scaling up and down to fill screen. \r\n* 100% realistic collisions\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\nThe plan is to release the game on Android market at some point. If it proves successful, the code might get ported to iOS and released on Apples marketplace. This is both time consuming and expensive, so it is not top priority as of now. The focus will be on releasing and improving the Android version. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

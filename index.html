<a name="welcome-to-dx-ball-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-dx-ball-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to DX Ball Github Pages.</h3>

<p>This project is first and foremost a hobby project for fun, to create my own game and to learn. The name is just temporary until I can come up with a name of my own. </p>

<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>DX Ball is a Breakout type game where you have a ball and try to hit it with your paddle and knock away all the tiles. My clone will be quite similar to DX Ball, but with some differences. </p>

<h3>
<a name="technology" class="anchor" href="#technology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technology</h3>

<p>Whereas the original was only for Windows, this game will be multi-platform. It'll be made using the SDL 2.0 library. This means the code can run on virtually any platform ( Linux, Androird, Windows, iOS, OS X, etc... ) It also means that the code will run very smoothly. Currently the average FPS lives from 200 - 500, peaking at more than 10000 FPS. </p>

<p>Language wise the game is based on C++11. Most platforms support this newer version of C++ with the exception of iOS. For the iOS version, the C++11 code will have to be ported to Objective C. </p>

<h3>
<a name="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h3>

<p>The plan is to release the game on Android market at some point. If it proves successful, the code might get ported to iOS and released on Apples marketplace. This is both time consuming and expensive, so it is not top priority as of now. The focus will be on releasing and improving the Android version. </p>
